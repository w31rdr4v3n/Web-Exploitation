This first lab is based on NGINX. Your mission is to access the hidden location placed at ```/flag``` and grab the flag. The endpoint itself get's served by a ```agassou``` server running somewhere in the background of the public localhost server. Don't forget the ```\r\n``` magic. Appending ```Content-Length``` might help and needs to be adjusted to get the exploit running. Time for some piggybacking
